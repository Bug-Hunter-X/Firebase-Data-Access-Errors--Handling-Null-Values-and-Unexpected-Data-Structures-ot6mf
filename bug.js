The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data you're trying to access is not properly structured or doesn't exist. For example, if you attempt to read a property from a null value, you'll encounter a TypeError. This error can be especially tricky to track down in larger applications.

```javascript
//Problematic Code
const snapshot = await db.ref('users/uid/profile').once('value');
const displayName = snapshot.val().displayName; // Error if displayName doesn't exist
```
